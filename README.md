# Wishing Plan

Wishing Plan allows you to save your wishes and plan when you can buy them based on the price and the amount of money you set aside each month. The app will then track the your monthly savings and calculate when you are able to purchase your wishes.

You can also view a dashboard with a summary of their wishes and their progress towards achieving them. This app is useful for helping you save money and plan for their future purchases.

## [Project Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/mealtime-63451d87af35b0d2cfc42e0c/board)
**IMPORTANT**: In order to see our project board on ZenHub, you need to have an account and have connected it with your GitHub account.

For development management we are using [ZenHub Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/wishing-plan-637b3ad68b9646001dfac86a/board). It is recommended to install the browser [extension for ZenHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en), to be able to view information from our ZenHub board within GitHub. 

**NOTE:** ZenHub is not needed as the issues we are working on are shared between GitHub and ZenHub.
