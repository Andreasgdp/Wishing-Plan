# Development

## [Project Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/mealtime-63451d87af35b0d2cfc42e0c/board)

**IMPORTANT**: In order to see our project board on ZenHub, you need to have an account and have connected it with your GitHub account.

For development management we are using [ZenHub Board](https://app.zenhub.com/workspaces/wishing-plan-637b3ad68b9646001dfac86a/board). It is recommended to install the browser [extension for ZenHub](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zenhub-for-github/ogcgkffhplmphkaahpmffcafajaocjbd?hl=en), to be able to view information from our ZenHub board within GitHub.

**NOTE:** ZenHub is not needed as the issues we are working on are shared between GitHub and ZenHub.
